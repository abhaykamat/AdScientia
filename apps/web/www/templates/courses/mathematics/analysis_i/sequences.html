      <p>One of the most fundamental concepts in Analysis, and mathematics in general, is a <em>sequence</em>. A sequence can be thought of informally as an infinitely-long ordered list of elements picked from a certain set. For instance if our set is $\mathbb{Q}$ then we can construct an infinite list of rational numbers with a certain behaviour. We could also choose $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ if we are interested in numerical sequences. However, sequences are not restricted to containing only numbers. We could also construct a sequence consisting of <em>vectors</em>, <em>functions</em> or even more abstract sets.</p>

      <p>Sequences are used everywhere in mathematics and for a variety of purposes, primarily though to count elements in sets and determine their "size" or <em>cardinality</em>. We will be looking at sequences and seeing how they behave as we count higher and higher, attempting to investigate their behaviour as we count "infinitely" far along the list.</p>

      <p>In this Analysis course, we will only be looking at infinite numerical sequences, where our sequences consist of elements from $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$. In later courses we will investigate sequences of more abstract sets.</p>

      <p>A formal definition of an infinite sequence states that it is a map from the natural numbers to another set. Thus all infinite sequences are <em>countable</em>:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Definition (Sequence):</strong>
	A sequence $(a_n)$ of a set $S$ is a map $a_n : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow S$.
      </blockquote>

      <p>In general we will denote sequences by $(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ or simply $(a_n)$, where it is clear from the context that our counting variable $n$ is a member of the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$. Here are some examples of sequences:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 1</strong><br />
	$a_n = (n) = \left(1,2,3,4,5,...\right)$
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 2</strong><br />
	$b_n = (n^2) = \left(1,4,9,16,25,...\right)$
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 3</strong><br />
	$c_n = ((-1)^{n}) = \left(-1,1,-1,1,-1,...\right)$
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 4</strong><br />
	$d_n = (n/(n+1)) = \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{4},\frac{4}{5},\frac{5}{6},...\right)$
      </blockquote>

      <p>It is natural to consider what will happen to a sequence as we increase $n$. If we take Example 1, it is clear that as $n$ increases, the elements of the sequence are getting larger. Consider picking a number, $N\in\mathbb{N}$. Eventually the sequence will go beyond this number. In fact, no matter which $N$ you pick, the sequence will always eventually exceed this value. The same holds true for Example 2. We call sequences of this type <em>divergent</em>. More formally:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Definition (Divergent Sequence to Infinity)</strong><br />
	A sequence $(a_n)$ is <strong>divergent to infinity</strong> (or <em>tends to infinity</em>) if and only if, for any $K\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$, where $N = N(K)$, such that $a_n > K$, for <em>all</em> $n>N$. This is written as $a_n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 1</strong><br />
	% Fill in these with some example sequences of $a_n\rightarrow\infty$ 
      </blockquote>

      <p>Sequences can also tend to negative infinity and a similar definition exists for sequences of this type:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Definition (Divergent Sequence to Negative Infinity)</strong><br />
	A sequence $(a_n)$ is <strong>divergent to negative infinity</strong> (or <em>tends to negative infinity</em>) if and only if, for any $K\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$, where $N = N(K)$, such that $a_n < -K$, for <em>all</em> $n>N$. This is written as $a_n \rightarrow -\infty$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.
      </blockquote> 

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Example 1</strong><br />
	% Fill in these with some example sequences of $a_n\rightarrow -\infty$ 
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Remark</strong><br />
	Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence such that $a_n \rightarrow -\infty$. Then $(-a_n) \rightarrow \infty$.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Once we have a divergent sequence $b_n$, say, it is possible to show that if $a_n \geq b_n$ for every $n$, then $a_n$ is necessarily a divergent sequence.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
	<strong>Theorem</strong><br />
	Let $(a_n)$, $(b_n)$ be sequences of real numbers and $M\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. If $a_n \geq b_n$ for all $n \geq M$ and $b_n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, then $a_n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.<br /><br />
	<strong>Proof</strong><br />
	Let $K$ be a positive number. Since $b_n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, there exists $C\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b_n > K$, for all $n > C$. Now let $N = max\{M,C\}$. Then for all $n>N$ we have $a_n \geq b_n > K$ and thus $a_n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
      </blockquote>

      <p>There is an analogous result (with very similar proof) for sequences divergent to negative infinity:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
	<strong>Theorem</strong><br />
	Let $(a_n)$, $(b_n)$ be sequences of real numbers and $M\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. If $a_n \leq b_n$ for all $n \geq M$ and $b_n \rightarrow -\infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, then $a_n \rightarrow -\infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.<br /><br />
	<strong>Proof</strong><br />
	Let $K$ be a negative number. Since $b_n \rightarrow -\infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, there exists $C\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $b_n < -K$, for all $n > C$. Now let $N = max\{M,C\}$. Then for all $n>N$ we have $a_n \leq b_n < -K$ and thus $a_n \rightarrow -\infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Divergent sequences are not the only type of sequences. If we take Example 4, we can see that elements of $d_n$ are becoming closer and closer to the number $1$. If we take $n=1000$, for example, the sequence element would be $d_{1000} = \frac{1000}{1001} \approx 0.999$, which is very close to $1$.</p>

      <h3>Limit of a Sequence</h3>

      <p>What if we think about n "equalling" $\infty$? Since $\infty$ is not a member of the natural numbers (i.e. $\infty \notin \mathbb{N}$), we have to state how our sequence behaves as $n$ <em>approaches</em> $\infty$, which we denote as $n \rightarrow \infty$. It is apparent, although not proven formally, that $d_n$ will become $1$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Thus we say that the <em>limit</em> of the sequence $d_n$ is $\infty$. We can write this more succintly using the "lim" notation:</p>

      <p>
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} d_n = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{n}{n+1}\right) = 1
	\end{eqnarray*}
      </p>

      <p>The above formal notation states that the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ of our sequence $d_n$ is equal to $1$.</p>

      <p>For Example 3, the numbers are alternating between -1 and 1. This means that the sequence $c_n$ does not have a limit.</p>

      <p>For the sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ the values continually increase as $n\rightarrow \infty$, although at different <em>rates</em>. We can see that $b_n$ gets larger far more quickly than $a_n$. We say that $a_n$ and $b_n$ tend to $\infty$.</p>

      <p>Although we have described informally the concept of a limit, we haven't placed it on firm mathematical ground. The formal definition for a limit involves the concept of <em>distance</em> between elements of the sequence. In our previous discussion on inequalities, we made use of the <em>absolute</em> or <em>modulus</em> operator to describe a number's magnitude.</p>

      <p>Given that our prior discussion on sequences (and in particular $d_n$) centred on the elements of the sequence becoming closer and closer to $1$, a natural step is to ask what happens to the distance between the limit element (if it exists) and successive elements of the sequence. We should expect that if our sequence $a_n$ has a limit (which we will denote as $a$), then successive elements $a_n$ will become closer to $a$, i.e. $|a_n - a|$ will decrease in size.</p>

      <p>The key concept in the definition of a sequence limit is to realise that if $a_n$ has a limit $a$, then by increasing $n$ to a sufficiently large size, we can reduce the distance between successive elements of the sequence and our limit to whatever size we wish. Informally, as $n$ increases, the long-term distance between $a_n$ and $a$ decreases. If we pick a particularly small distance, which we can call $\epsilon$, then we should be able to find a number, which we call $N$, such that if our counting variable $n$ is greater than this number $N$, then the distance between $a_n$ and $a$ will always be less than $\epsilon$.</p>

      <p>This is not an intuitive definition on first glance. It requires a bit of thought before it is fully understood. It states that if $a_n$ has a limit $a$, then for any arbitrarily small distance $\epsilon$ that we pick, there exists a particular number $N$ after which the distance between $a_n$ and $a$ is less than $\epsilon$, as long as we have moved further along the counting sequence than $N$:</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Definition (Limit of a Sequence)</strong><br />
	A sequence $a_n$ has a limit $a$ if for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n - a| &lt; \epsilon$ whenever $n > N$.
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>% Use d_n to show that we can determine the limit</p>

      <p>% Give an example of a sequence which does NOT have a limit (and show epsilon/N arg)</p>
      
      <blockquote>
	<strong>Theorem</strong><br />
	Let $(a_n) \rightarrow a$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Then $(|a_n|) \rightarrow |a|$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.<br /></br />
	<strong>Proof</strong><br />
	Given that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n - a| < \epsilon$, for all $n > N$, we can say that $\left||a_n|-|a|\right| \leq |a_n - a|$, utilising our results from the Inequalities section. Thus:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
        \left||a_n|-|a|\right| &\leq& |a_n - a| < \epsilon
	\end{eqnarray*}
        which holds for all $n > N$. Hence we can make the distance between $|a_n|$ and $|a|$ as small as necessary. Thus $(|a_n|) \rightarrow |a|$.

      <p>% Theorem a_n -> 0 iff |a_n| -> 0</p>
      
      <p>% Definition of a divergent sequence</p>

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Theorem</strong><br />
	Let $(a_n)$ be a sequence. If $a_n > 0, \forall n \geq 1$, then $(a_n) \rightarrow \infty \Leftrightarrow (1/a_n) \rightarrow 0$.<br /><br />
	<strong>Proof</strong><br />
	We will show first that if $(a_n)\rightarrow \infty$, then $(1/a_n)\rightarrow 0$. Consider an $\epsilon > 0$. Since $\epsilon$ is positive, $1/\epsilon > 0$ is still positive. Since we have that $\exists N$ s.t. $a_n > 1/\epsilon, \forall n > N$ and that both $a_n>0$ as well as $1/\epsilon > 0$, we can say, $\forall n > N$:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
        \left|\frac{1}{a_n} - 0\right| &=& \left|\frac{1}{a_n}\right| = \frac{1}{a_n} < \epsilon
	\end{eqnarray*}
        Thus $(1/a_n)\rightarrow 0$ and we have shown the first side. Now let us suppose that $(1/a_n) \rightarrow 0$. If we choose $M>0$, then as before $1/M>0$. We know that $\exists N$ s.t. $\left|1/a_n\right| < 1/M, \forall n>N$, and that $\left|1/a_n\right| = 1/a_n$, thus it can be seen that $a_n > M, \forall n>N$ and hence $(a_n)\rightarrow \infty$.
      </blockquote>
